# pc-compression
Comparison of compression algorithms of point clouds.

## Roadmap

1. TODO Algorithm Survey
    > Draco, pccomp
    > Would like at least 4 algorithms
    > Likely have to implement my own (from a paper)
2. Experimental Setup
   1.  Which Datasets? 
   > Probably my own
   2.  TODO Which metrics?
   3.  General Experiment Design
   > Probably going to write ROS II nodes 
3. Evaluate
   > Gather all metrics and present them nicely using matplot or seaborn
